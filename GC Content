# The following will display the working nucleotide sequence

print ("Analyze the following nucleotide sequence: ")
flu_ns1_seq = 'GTGACAAAGACATAATGGATCCAAACACTGTGTCAAGCTTTCAGGTAGATTGCTTTCTTTGGCATGTCCGCAAACGAGTTGCAGACCAAGAACTAGGTGA'
print (flu_ns1_seq)


# Next, we'll put the string flu_ns1_seq in a readable format to calculate GC Content
## We'll need a list!

print (type(flu_ns1_seq))                   # Shows variable type for flu_ns1_seq
characters = list(flu_ns1_seq)              # Makes flu_ns1_seq into a list called characters
print (type (characters))                   # Shows variable type for characters
print ("Now we have a list")


# Determine how many C and G nucleotides are in the list 'characters'

C_count = characters.count('C')             # This is the C Content
G_count = characters.count('G')             # This is the G Content

## Next we'll need to sum these two character counts

GC_sum = G_count + C_count
print (GC_sum)
print ("Now we know the sum of G and C nucleotides are in flu_ns1_seq")


# We need to determine how many total nucleotides are in flu_ns1_seq

print ("The total amount of nucleotides in flu_ns1_seq is: ")

# Finally we need to divide the GC content by the total number of nucleotides
print ("Now will determine GC content of flu_ns1_seq")
print ("Recall that the GC sum is: ")
print (GC_sum)
print ("And the total amount of nucleotides is: ")
print (All_nucleotides)
print ("So the GC content of the flu_ns1_seq sequence is: ")
GC_content = GC_sum / All_nucleotides
print (GC_content)

## As a percentage
GC_percent = GC_content * 100
print (GC_percent)
